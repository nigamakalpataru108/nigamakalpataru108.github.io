# SP Lawyer Project

_"Just see - you are not reading my books. **You have to read my books and you have to study and learn my books just like a lawyer learns the law books.** You must know everything chapter and verse. If you do not know, how will you teach these men unless you know my books."_ (Srila Prabhupada Room Conversation with Bhagavat Das Vanachari, Bombay, 1974)

This Module is for training devotees to memorize verses from important scriptures like Bhagavad-Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, Bhakti Rasamrta Sindhu etc as per the dream of Srila Prabhupada.
